# Spell the Pok√©mon - Back-end

Back-end using Node/JS/Express/GraphQL/Postgres. You can only register for now (with the insertion in the database), and the communciation between Front and Back is set with Express and GraphQL, making it really easy to read and develop.

To make it run, you have to have opened a Postgres database, and put the vars in 'db.js'.
